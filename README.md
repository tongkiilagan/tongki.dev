# tongki.dev website 

This is my website about my personal life, hobbies, and interests.

It is built with the following:
- Rust
    - Axum
- HTMX
- mini.css framework
- MongoDB (?)

One of the key features of the website is its strongly typed data that ensures pages will render with complete
data retrieved from a database.
